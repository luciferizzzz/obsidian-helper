# ✨ Why ObsKit?

Managing notes shouldn't require opening a GUI every few minutes.

Instead of:

```
Open App
↓
Find Folder
↓
Create Note
↓
Rename
↓
Move
↓
Close App
```

Just type:

```bash
obs new Notes "Learning Rust"
```

Done.

ObsKit lets you manage your entire Markdown knowledge base directly from your terminal.

# 📖 Introduction

ObsKit is an **independent Markdown knowledge management toolkit**.

It manages Markdown files **directly through the filesystem**.

- ✅ Fully compatible with Obsidian vaults.
- ✅ Does **not** communicate with the Obsidian application.
- ✅ Does **not** rely on proprietary Obsidian APIs.
- ✅ Multiple applications can safely work with the same Markdown vault.

**Conceptually**

```text

 ┌──────┼─────────┐
 │      │         │
 ▼      ▼         ▼
Obsidian  ObsKit  VS Code
```

Obsidian stores notes as standard Markdown files — that is why ObsKit works with Obsidian vaults. No proprietary integration is involved.

# 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luciferizzzz/obskit.git

cd obskit

npm install

npm link
```

The CLI executable is `obs`.

---

# ⚙️ Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (uses modern features like `fetch` and `AbortController`).
- **npm** for installation.
- A Markdown knowledge vault (for example, an Obsidian vault) on your filesystem.

---

# 🛠️ Configuration

ObsKit reads a single **`config.json`** in the project root.

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `vault` | Absolute path to your Markdown vault |
| `ai` | AI provider settings (Ollama / OpenAI) |

Initialize the vault path:

```bash
obs init
```

> **Required.** ObsKit must know your vault before any vault command can run.
> `obs init` saves the path to `config.json`. Without it, commands fail with a clear
> `Vault is not configured` error (run `obs init` to fix).

Manage configuration:

```bash
obs config
obs config show
obs config set
obs config ai
obs config reset
```

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for the full reference.

---

# ⚡ Quick Start

Create your first note

```bash
obs new Notes "Learning Rust"
```

Find notes

```bash
obs find rust
```

Generate AI content

```bash
obs ai "Explain Rust ownership"
```
