# 🌌 Long-term Vision

Obsidian Helper aims to become the **definitive command-line companion for Obsidian** — and eventually a full knowledge-management platform.

The journey:

1. **Terminal-first note management** — everything you do daily in Obsidian, from the CLI.
2. **Intelligent knowledge tools** — graph analysis, orphans, backlinks, AI-assisted writing.
3. **Interactive experience** — a polished, keyboard-driven TUI with autocomplete and fuzzy search.
4. **Multi-vault & automation** — profiles, scripting, and plugins for power users.
5. **Platform** — REST API, web dashboard, cloud backup, and MCP integration that lets any AI tool talk to your vault.

**The end goal:** a single, fast, open-source layer that manages, analyzes, and augments your knowledge — whether you are in the terminal, the browser, or an AI assistant.

# 🧭 Guiding Principles

These principles shape every roadmap decision:

- **Fast and lightweight** — no bloat; performance is a feature.
- **Terminal-first** — the CLI is the primary interface.
- **Safe by default** — the user's notes are never corrupted or lost.
- **Reusable architecture** — small commands, shared utilities, easy to extend.
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Open and community-driven** — contributions and feedback shape the roadmap.
- **AI as an enhancer, not a replacement** — AI augments workflows but the user stays in control.

# 🤖 Planned AI Evolution

| Version | AI capability |
|---------|---------------|
| v1.2.1 – v1.4.4 | Note generation, daily journal, tomorrow/update/weekly planning, template filling |
| v1.5 | AI-powered fuzzy search and note suggestions |
| v1.6 | Relationship suggestions, AI tagging, AI summaries |
| v2.0 | Scriptable AI, batch processing, AI-powered organization |
| v3.0 | **AI Ecosystem** — writing, linking, summarization, and more; **MCP server** so any AI tool can access the vault |

The AI module is designed to grow: new providers, new workflows, and deeper integration with the vault graph — all through the same unified `utils/ai.js` interface (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).
